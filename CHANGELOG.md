# Changelog

## [1.3]
- Tracker will now start at "Day 1", 8am, when no `startTime` property is provided.
- Added optional `fc-calendar` property parsing, to display fantasy weekday and month names from Calendarium plugin.

## [1.2]
- Updated timestamp formatting to make the tracker more neatly spaced. Thanks to @deViate for the code!

## [1.1]
- Different types of effects (light sources and custom effects) can now expire on the same turn and are displayed side by side after the checkbox placeholder, minimizing additional row width.
